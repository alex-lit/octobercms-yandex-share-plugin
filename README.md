### Available languages:

- English


### Quickstart guide:

1. Go to the 'System' tab in October, and install the plugin using the AlexLit.EarthNullSchoolMaps code.
2. After installation has finished a new component will appear in under Octobers 'CMS > Components' tab. You have the option to add this to only one page, or add it to a layout making it appear on all pages that use the layout. Whichever you chose the instructions are the same.
3. Open the your selected page/layout, and add the component to it.
4. Add component code anywhere on the page/layout.
5. That's it. You now have a working EarthNullSchoolMaps on your page. It has no outside dependencies, so you don't have to worry about anything else.

## Options
- **Height** - atmospheric pressure corresponds roughly to altitude several pressure layers are meteorologically interesting they show data assuming the earth is completely smooth note: 1 hectopascal (hPa) = 1 millibar (mb)
    - **Surface** - the "Surface" layer represents conditions at ground or water level this layer follows the contours of mountains, valleys, etc.
    - **1000hPa** ~100 m, near sea level conditions
    - **850hPa** ~1,500 m, planetary boundary, low
    - **700hPa** ~3,500 m, planetary boundary, high
    - **500hPa** ~5,000 m, vorticity
    - **250hPa** ~10,500 m, jet stream
    - **70hPa** ~17,500 m, stratosphere
    - **10hPa** ~26,500 m, even more stratosphere
- **Overlay** - show another dimension of data using color some overlays are valid at a specific height while others are valid for the entire thickness of the atmosphere
    - **Wind** - wind speed at specified height
    - **Temp** - temperature at specified height
    - **RH** - relative humidity at specified height
    - **WPD** - Instantaneous Wind Power Density. Measure of power available in the wind: ½ρv3, where ρ is air density and v is wind velocity
    - **TPW** - Total Precipitable Water. Total amount of water in a column of air stretching from ground to space
    - **TCW** - Total Cloud Water. Total amount of water in clouds in a column of air from ground to space
    - **3HPA** - 3-hour Precipitation Accumulation. Amount of precipitation over the next three hours
    - **CAPE** - Convective Available Potential Energy from Surface. Indicates the buoyancy of air, a measure of atmospheric instability and predictor of severe weather
    - **MSLP** - Mean Sea Level Pressure. Air pressure reduced to sea level
    - **MI** - Misery Index. Perceived air temperature as combination of heat index and wind chill
    - **SST** - Sea Surface Temperature. Temperature of the ocean surface
    - **SSTA** - Sea Surface Temperature Anomaly. Difference in ocean temperature from daily average during years 1981-2011
    - **HTSGW** - Significant Wave Height. Roughly equal to mean wave height as estimated by a "trained observer"
    - **COsc** - Carbon Monoxide Surface Concentration. The fraction of carbon monoxide present in air at the earth's surface
    - **CO<sub>2</sub>sc** - Carbon Dioxide Surface Concentration. The fraction of carbon dioxide present in air at the earth's surface
    - **SO<sub>2</sub>sm** - Sulfur Dioxide Surface Mass. Amount of sulfur dioxide in the air near the earth's surface
    - **DUex** - Dust Extinction. The aerosol optical thickness (AOT) of light at 550 nm due to dust
    - **SO<sub>4</sub>ex** - Sulfate Extinction. The aerosol optical thickness (AOT) of light at 550 nm due to sulfate
- **Projection**
    - **Atlantis**
    - **Azimuthal Equidistant**
    - **Conic Equidistant**
    - **Equirectangular**
    - **Orthographic**
    - **Patterson**
    - **Stereographic**
    - **Waterman Butterfly**
    - **Winkel Tripel**
- **Map width** - Map width in pixels or percents
- **Map height** - Map height in pixels or percents
- **Longitude** - Longitude (-360 - 360). Example: -214.68
- **Latitude** - Latitude (-360 - 360). Example: 14.2
- **Zoom** - Zoom (0-3000)
